What's experiment tracking?
    - Experiment tracking is the process of keeping track of all the relevant information
    from an ML experiment, which includes:
        - Source code
        - Environment
        - Data
        - Model
        - Hyperparameters
        - Metrics
        ...
Why is experiment tracking so important?
    - In general, because of these 3 main reasons:
        - Reproducibility
        - Organization
        - Optimization

Tracking experiments in spreadsheets
    - Why is this not enough?
        - error-prone
        - no standard format
        - visibility & collaboration
MLflow
    - Definition: "An open-source platform for the machine learning lifecycle"
    - In practice, it's just a Python package that can be installed with pip, and it contains four main modules:
        - Tracking
        - Models
        - Model Registry
        - Projects

Tracking experiments with MLflow
    - The MLflow Tracking Module allows you to organize your experiments into runs, and to keep track of:
        - Parameters
        - Metrics
        - Metadata
        - Artifacts
        - Models
    - Along with this information, MLflow automatically logs extra information about the run:
        - Source code
        - Version of the code (git commit)
        - Start and end time
        - Author
