MLOPs Maturity Model

Level 0: No automation
    - Using a jupyter notebook, all code in jupyter notebook
    - Good for Proof of Concept: Start creating a model and now you need to further develop it
Level 1: DevOps, No MLOPs
    - Experience developers, use best engineering processes
    - Possible to deploy a model
    - Releases are automated
    - They are not ML-aware
    - CI/code
    - OPS Metrics
    - No experiment tracking
    - No reproducibility
    - DS separated from engineers
    - POC -> Production
Level 2: Automated Training
    - Training Pipeline
    - Experiment tracking
    - Model Registry
    - Low friction development
    - DS work with engineers
Level 3: Automated Deployment
    - Easy to deploy model
    - A/B Test
    - Model Monitoring
Level 4: Full MLOPs Automated 
    -
